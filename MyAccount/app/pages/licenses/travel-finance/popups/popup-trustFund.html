        <p><b>Trust Fund</b> means the funds held to offset services that have not yet been provided to a client of a travel supplier. 
        These funds must be held in a savings institution account, which is formally designated as a trust account. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Trust funds are equal to, or greater than, outstanding liability to clients if the amount in a trust is at least equal to the amount of prepayment received from clients, 
            less the amount that the travel supplier has already paid.
